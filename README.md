# ComputerLogic

Small projekt to experiment with logic gates.

# How To:

Open Unity in this projekt and press play.
On the left are some blocks:
- Switch
- Lamp
- Wire
- And gate
- Or gate
- XOR
- Not gate
- NAND gate
- NOR gate

You can place the gates or items in any order but to get the best chance of it working first place out the wires and then the components on top of the gates.
__REMEMBER__: The wires has to go under the components to work. IE the switch needs a wire under it and not just besides it.
